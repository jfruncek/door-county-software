Project myTunes
----------------------

Welcome.

Getting Started
---------------

  - create a model class, conforming to the conventions
  - described in the documentation (see jmatter/doc/guide.pdf)
  - add type to src/com/u2d/class-list.json

  Then:
   ant genhbm
      ..will automatically create hibernate hbm.xml mapping files for your model classes
      you can navigate through the package hierarchy under build/classes and locate the
       generated hbm.xml files for your model classes.
   ant schema-export
      ..will automatically create and export the ddl to your database
      you should be able to connect to your database and see the generated tables at
      this point.

  Place image files for your new type in resources/images
    (see the README file in that directory)

  Then:
    ant run

   ..will automatically launch your application.  by default, a single user will
   already exist in the system:  username: admin with password: admin
   passwords are hashed and then stored in the database.  Feel free to create
   new users via the gui.

   If you wish to customize a splash screen for your application, simply
   put a "splash.gif" (or png or jpg) in resources/images.


Thank you for using JMatter.
