= Resources =
 
Admittedly I am sold on Google Apps. I use them personally and find that they work flawlessly with Microsoft format documents. Yet they are accessible anywhere, enable easier collaboration, and require less computing resources (and less cost - they are free for personal use).

For business use, these benefits exist and more. See the following links:

There are some things we need to find out before moving to  Google Apps.

  * What version of Exchange are we running?
  * What is the size of our current Internet pipeline?
  * How many in-boxes do we need?
