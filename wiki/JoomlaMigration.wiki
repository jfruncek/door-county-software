#summary Migration of umcwfb.org to Joomla

=The Migration Process=

The Web Ministry team will work closely with the staff, ministry leaders, and others to define a website migration strategy. The migration process includes the following steps:

==Develop a Migration Plan==
The Web Ministry team will meet with staff and ministry leaders to discuss website needs and to develop a migration plan. The plan will include identifying content to be deleted, updated, or added before it is converted to Joomla; defining any custom content types; creating any new content; developing a project timeline; identifying individuals to be involved in the transition; clarifying the roles and responsibilities of those individuals; and identifying and delivering needed training.

==Create the new Joomla site==
The new site will be created by the individuals identified in the migration plan. These individuals can include members of the Web ministry team, staff, and/or ministry leaders.

==Provide user training for the site's support==
Training will be provided in the form of workshops or individual training sessions. Ongoing support will be available from the Web Ministry team, but the day-to-day updates of the converted sites will be the responsibility of the staff or ministry leaders or their designees.

==Follow-up==
Conduct a post-migration assessment to evaluate the migration process and obtain client feedback.
