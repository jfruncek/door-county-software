#summary Migration of umcwfb.org to Joomla

=The Migration Process=

The Web Ministry team will work closely with the staff, ministry leaders, and others to define a website migration strategy. The migration process includes the following steps:

==Develop and Execute a Content Migration Plan==
The Web Ministry team will meet with staff and ministry leaders to discuss website needs and to develop a migration plan. The plan will include

  # Interview content owners to determine their needs and goals for the site
  # Review existing content â€“ editing and deleting as necessary
  # Determine any new content that needs to be added
  # Determine frequency of updates moving forward
  # Assign responsibilities to authors of that content
  # Identify any needed training

==Create the new Joomla site==
The new site will be created by the individuals identified in the migration plan. These individuals can include members of the Web ministry team, staff, and/or ministry leaders. We will need to 

  # Organize the content
  # Create a sitemap
  # Create wireframes of key pages
  # Design the look and feel (css)
  # Configure Joomla and any needed extensions
  # Complete any needed custom programming
  # Test the new site
  # Launch the new site

==Provide user training for the site's support==
Training will be provided in the form of workshops or individual training sessions. Ongoing support will be available from the Web Ministry team, but the day-to-day updates of the converted sites will be the responsibility of the staff or ministry leaders or their designees.

==Follow-up==
Conduct a post-migration assessment to evaluate the migration process and obtain client feedback.
