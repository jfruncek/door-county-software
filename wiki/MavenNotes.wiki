= Conventions =
  * Standard directory layout for projects
  * A single Maven project produces a single output
  * Standard naming conventions (such as {{{commons-logging-1.2.jar}}}

Maven's Super POM carries with it all the default conventions that Maven encourages, and is the analog of the Java language's java.lang.Object class.

= Plugins ==
  * everything accomplished in Maven is the result of a plugin executing
  * execution is coordinated by Maven's build life cycle in a declarative fashion

= Dependencies ==

  * The dependencies element contained within the dependencyManagement element areused only to state the preference for a version and by itself does not affect a project's dependency graph, whereas the top-level dependencies element does affect the dependency graph

_not totally sure what this means yet- version is required in the dependencyManagement element but not in the dependencies element_
