= Conventions =
  * Standard directory layout for projects
  * A single Maven project produces a single output
  * Standard naming conventions (such as {{{commons-logging-1.2.jar}}}

Maven's Super POM carries with it all the default conventions that Maven encourages, and is the analog of the Java language's java.lang.Object class.

= Plugins ==
  * everything accomplished in Maven is the result of a plugin executing
  * execution is coordinated by Maven's build life cycle in a declarative fashion

= Dependencies ==

  * The dependencies contained within the {{{dependencyManagement}}} element are used only to state the preference for a version and by themselves do not affect a project's dependency graph, whereas the top-level {{{dependencies}}} element does. _This means that a dependency *must* be inherited or explicitly declared in the {{{dependencies}}} element. Also version is required in the {{{dependencyManagement}}} element but not in the {{{dependencies}}} element_
  * order of elements doesn't matter

||{{{mvn help:describe -Dplugin=org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-jarsigner-plugin -Ddetail}}} || describes goals and parameters for a plugin || ||
||{{{mvn help:effective-pom}}}||Combines the project POM with the contents of all parent POMs, user settings, and any active profiles. This goal can come in handy if you are trying to debug a build and want to see how all of the current project's ancestor POMs are contributing to the effective POM. ||[http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Inheritance Inheritance] ||
