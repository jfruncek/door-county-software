#summary Thoughts and ideas around reports and reporting

= Testing Reports =

== What can we verify? ==
  
     * Runs for a given set of parameters
     * Tables exist with certain headings
     * Report is not "empty" (there are rows in the tables)
     * Data is not "missing"- defined as blanks, all zeroes
     * Verify totals against a check query or among reports
     * Correct "as of" date for parameter, fund description, report title
     * For some reports they don't like it if there's more than one page

= Mavenized Open Reports =

 * Removed JFree, Mondrian, BIRT, eSpreadsheet, Stark custom
 * Must mvn install Oracle driver locally: `mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.oracle -DartifactId=ojdbc6 -Dversion=11.2.0.1 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=ojdbc6.jar`
 * Added a `ReportPostProcessor` interface (no impl)
 * Need to decide about `StarkApplicationContext`
