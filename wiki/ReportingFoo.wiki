#summary Mavenized Open Reports and other reporting ideas

= Mavenized Open Reports =

 * Removed JFree (including Chart reports), Mondrian (including JPivot & WCF), BIRT, eSpreadsheet, Stark custom
 * Must mvn install missing (non-Maven) jars including JDBC drivers and Jasper - see doc/Jars_added folder
 * Added a `ReportPostProcessor` interface (no impl)
 * Nearly works with jetty:run - issue with security
 * Should add a pure java db config

== Testing Reports ==

=== What can we verify? ===
  
     * Runs for a given set of parameters
     * Tables exist with certain headings
     * Report is not "empty" (there are rows in the tables)
     * Data is not "missing"- defined as blanks, all zeroes
     * Verify totals against a check query or among reports
     * Correct "as of" date for parameter, fund description, report title
     * For some reports they don't like it if there's more than one page
