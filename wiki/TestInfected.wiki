#summary Experiences with learning to write test-driven code

= Uncle bob's Prime Factors =

Code in Door Sandbox. Lessons learned:
  * Dropped back to `sysout` when tests failed, which wasn't terrible, but could more tests have been written on smaller methods instead?
  * Need to add more robust test data set? Reading tests from a simple text file is a good idea!
  * Also need to refactor
  * Instance of `PrimeFactors` was easier to test than static class
